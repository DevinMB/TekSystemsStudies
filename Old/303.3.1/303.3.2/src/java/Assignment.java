//		Write a program that creates an array of integers with a length of 3. Assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to the indexes. Print out each array element.
//		
//		Write a program that returns the middle element in an array. Give the following values to the integer array: {13, 5, 7, 68, 2} and produce the following output: 7
//		 
//		Write a program that creates an array of String type and initializes it with the strings “red”, “green”, “blue” and “yellow”. Print out the array length. Make a copy using the clone( ) method. Use the Arrays.toString( ) method on the new array to verify that the original array was copied.
//		 
//		Write a program that creates an integer array with 5 elements (i.e., numbers). The numbers can be any integers.  Print out the value at the first index and the last index using length - 1 as the index. Now try printing the value at index = length ( e.g., myArray[myArray.length ] ).  Notice the type of exception which is produced. Now try to assign a value to the array index 5. You should get the same type of exception.
//		 
//		Write a program where you create an integer array with a length of 5. Loop through the array and assign the value of the loop control variable (e.g., i) to the corresponding index in the array.
//		 
//		Write a program where you create an integer array of 5 numbers. Loop through the array and assign the value of the loop control variable multiplied by 2 to the corresponding index in the array.
//		 
//		Write a program where you create an array of 5 elements. Loop through the array and print the value of each element, except for the middle (index 2) element.
